The PSG file format is a simple sound chip port write log file. It is similar to the VGM (Video Game Music) file format, but PSG only supports the SN76489 sound chip and also supports data compression.
This repository contains some Windows command-line utilities for managing PSG files, as well as a Z80 assembly-based PSG player library written to the Videoton TV Computer.

## VGM2PSG
VGM2PSG is a tool to convert VGM music files to PSG file format. Handles resampling of the original VGM file for frame-based timing of the PSGF file. The frame rate is 50 Hz, but can be changed with a command line switch. It also supports SN76489 frequency command recalculation to handle differences in chip clock frequency. The default clock is 3.579 MHz, but this also can be changed with a command line switch. The output format is the binary PSG file, but the program can also produce build-friendly '.db' data blocks.
